# Astro Basic Blog Template 🚀

Hey there, this is my very first astro theme that I will create.
This blog template is made with [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for the Front-end.

You can [create an Issue](https://github.com/lancerossdev/astro-basic-blog/issues/new) if you think there's something wrong or you want to add a new feature on this blog template. I will appreciate your help!

I will try to update this every time when I encountered an issue I forgot to fix.

## Dev Notes 📝

You can use `npm i` or `pnpm i` to install dependencies. I personally use `yarn` because it's what I use on most of my projects.

`yarn` - Installs dependencies. You can use any of those.

`yarn dev` - Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`

`yarn build` - Build your production site to `./dist/`

`yarn preview` - Preview your build locally, before deploying
